# NodeJS TypeScript Quickstart

This is to simply provide a boilerplate for my nodejs typescript projects. This should provide configuration for the following features:

* typescript compilation/runtime via `tsc` and `ts-node`
* linting/formatting through `eslint` and `prettier`
* environment values support through `dotenv` and `ts-env` for type protection

Things to add in the future:

* unit testing via `jest`
